# nbody
The n body problem is easy

TODO:
1. erase objects that leave the area.

2. Limit maximum body count

3. Handle collisions

4. Visual trails

5. Allow dragging existing objects?

6. Allow a single fixed object to prevent the action leaving the view area
(Or auto focus the largest object?)

7. Colour the bodies
